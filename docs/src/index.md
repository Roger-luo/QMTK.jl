# QMTK

Welcome to QMTK (Quantum Many-body Toolkit)

The [QMTK](@ref) library is developed for physics system involves quantum many-body system, including condensed matter physics, quantum computing, quantum information and etc.

In most numerical and theoretical works, programs related to quantum physics and quantum many-body system could have a lot similar functionality, methods, and objects. We aims to provide physicist with a powerful toolkit in Julia language as its frontend interface.

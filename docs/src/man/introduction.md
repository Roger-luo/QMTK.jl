# [Introduction](@id man-introduction)

The [QMTK](@ref homepage) library is developed for physics system involves quantum many-body system, including condensed matter physics, quantum computing, quantum information and etc.

In most numerical and theoretical works, programs related to quantum physics and quantum many-body system could have a lot similar functionality, methods, and objects. We aims to offer a collection of algorithms, object abstractions for quantum many-body system, which will ease your daily work. QMTK aims to provide physicist with a powerful toolkit in Julia language as its frontend interface. Although, Julia language is a promising language for scientific computing, we are not limited to Julia.

This project also aims to start an active developers community, we accept any feature request related to the following topic:

- quantum many-body system
- quantum information (including quantum computing)
- condensed matter physics

If you wish to have a new feature, or you wish to contribute to this project, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/Roger-luo/QMTK.jl/issues) to discuss the details and then start your pull request or your pull request may not be merged.

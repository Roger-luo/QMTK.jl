Sample Plan contains a distribution and a sampler.

## Interface

- `state(plan::SamplePlan) -> SamplerState`: get sampler's state
- `update!(plan::SamplePlan) -> SamplePlan`: update sample plan according to the sampler
- `show(plan::SamplePlan)`: print verbose information

## Note

using a list of distribution (probability) is also allowed. This means you have
to define your list type as a subtype of `AbstractVector` and it has to support
`getindex` method at least.

using a `Function` as your distribution is more common. And you can define your
custom type of distribution function by define a subtype of `Function` with its
`call` method (AKA `function (f::YourFunctionType)(x)`).
